# Fanbank React Coding Test

You'll need to clone this repo locally so that you and your future teammates can work through some issues and make improvements to the code together.

Feel free to ask questions or consult any internet resources. The goal is to see how you work and how well we all work together.

## 1. Make it run

The code is currently not in a working state. You'll need to setup your enviroment and make the code run and render the main page correctly in the browser.

## 2. Add a new component

Create a new component with a text input field and add that component to the main page.

## 3. Data entry

Display the input from the text field in your new component as text on the page.

## 4. Style it

Add some styles to the page to make everything centered and also make the logo display half it's normal size when viewed on a mobile device.
